# To-Do-List

Every person has got their `to-do list.`

In the to-do list, you can properly arrange your daily life schedule. If not so, you can note down your list of goals to attain in a year or so.
To-do lists not only help you arrange your life schedules but also help you discover your unfulfilled wishes. It is not always possible to carry a pen and pencil wherever you go to note down your desires or tasks to-do list.
